    <strong><h2>Projects</h2></strong>

    <h3>Thesis  </h3>
    <p align="justify">Within the final year of study at Maynooth University, the thesis title worked on was 'Horizontal Gene Transfer in the Development and Adaptation of Plants." Intense research was completed on the topic to fully understand the effect of horizontal gene transfer in eukaryotes, more specifically parasitic plants.</p>

     <h3>Dissertation </h3>
     <p align="justify">Within the third year of study at Maynooth University, the dissertation title worked on was "The Role of the Non-Coding Genome in Neuropsychiatric Disorders." Many hours of research within the field of genetics and human development were done, as well as a background into psychology to understand how neuropsychiatric disorders affect the human brain. Lots of research was done on introns and their role within DNA. </p></font> </td>
